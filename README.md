I chose a haiku on wind inspired by Basho- 

"this wind

how it changes direction -

my fickle mind"

For the visual representation,I tried to depict the moving nature of wind and how it is compared to the fickle mindedness in a human. 
I decided to scatter each sentence to show a sense of confusion, and to depict the fickle mindedness, next the words keep moving at different rates, and depict the different direction of wind as mentioned in the haiku.I tried to play arounf with the text floating around the mouse , this text shows the entire haiku. For the third sentence, i increased the speed, to show inconstant change of mind as mentioned in the poem.
